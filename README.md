# Performance is the priority

Nitroserver is based on making performance as good as possible, on a serverside level whilst allowing vanilla clients to join. It utilizes mods such as Lithium, Krypton, Noisium, ServerCore and C2ME to speed up the serverside operations.

Generally, Nitroserver will outperform other modpacks of its kind whilst updating quicker and adapting faster.

Nitroserver maintains 100% vanilla parity, however it optimizes the server in the following areas:
- Chunk load times decreased by ~70-90% via Noisium and C2ME
- Memory usage decreased via FerriteCore and ModernFix
- Entity spawning and fluid optimizations which makes the game run faster and more stably
- Redstone optimizations
- Serverside logic optimizations that make entities run better, lag less and improve performance

Nitroserver also includes only *Open Source* or *Source Visible* mods. Feel free to contribute to them all.
